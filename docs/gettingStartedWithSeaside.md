##Getting Started With Seaside

Once you have seaside loaded into your server Stone, you can start a web server and verify you can connect to it.

At the bash prompt, provided your $PATH includes $GS_HOME/shared/projects/GsDevKit_seaside31/bin, execute:

`
seasideWebServer seaside_3210 --start
`

Use your web browser to connect to the web server, if it is running on the same node:

![seaside web browser][3]
