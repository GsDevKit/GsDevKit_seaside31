##Getting Started With Seaside

Once you have seaside loaded into your server Stone, you can start a web server and verify you can connect to it.

#### Start the Seaside web server
At the bash prompt, provided your $PATH includes $GS_HOME/shared/projects/GsDevKit_seaside31/bin, execute:

`
seasideWebServer seaside_3210 --start
`

#### Connect to the web server

Use your web browser to connect to the web server.  

For example, if it is running on the same node, and you used the port 8383, you should get the seaside welcome page:
