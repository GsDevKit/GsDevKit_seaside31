#Seaside 31 for GsDevKit [![gs_master branch:](https://travis-ci.org/GsDevKit/GsDevKit_seaside31.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GsDevKit/GsDevKit_seaside31)

Seaside is a powerful framework for developing web applications. Seaside applications are composed of a tree of stateful web components that can easily implement sophisticated application behavior.

The [GsDevKit Seaside31 project][3] is a fork of the [Seaside project][4].  The GsDevKit Seaside31 project is an optional project to be installed into GsDevKit.


##Installation

You  may install the Seaside31 project into an existing GsDevKit installation, or if you have not installed GsDevKit, you may start off by installing a system that includes Seaside. 

In addition, you will need to install a GsDevKit tODE client to do the development work, which can be on the same machine as the Seaside stone and web server, or on a different machine.
